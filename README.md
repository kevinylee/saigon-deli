  Saigon Deli Website

## ðŸš€ Running Locally

1. Run the Netlify functions separately: `netlify functions:serve`
2. Run the website: `gatsby develop`

## Deploying to Production

All hooked up via Netlify.

## Todo
- [ ] Integrate `gatsby-image`
- [ ] Fix mobile view
- [ ] Refactor code structure

## Notes

When testing out branch deployments, make sure your `BASE_URL` is set correctly. In other words, you might have to use the preview deployment link rather than our production url in your code. Once you merge into `main`, then you can switch out the preview deployment link for the production url. This is because the production url does not have your latest code, until you merge into `main`.
